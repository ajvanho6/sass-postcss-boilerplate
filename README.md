# sass-postcss-boilerplate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ajvanho6/sass-postcss-boilerplate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ajvanho6/sass-postcss-boilerplate)

Simple front end boilerplate

This boilerplate contains some of basic gulp tasks which will speed up your workflow. 

It includes css, js and image minifiers, some postcss plugins to start with (lost grid, rucksack), and live browser syncing which reloads page automatically every time you change your code.

Enter your directory and just type npm install to install dependencies and then run gulp from command line to build boilerplate.
